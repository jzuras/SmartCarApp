# SmartCar App (MVC)

This is a learning project for myself, and it is not expected to be useful to the world at large. 

This project is a simple GUI that uses the SmartCar API. The purpose was to build a framework for testing a different API for a possible future project. My [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:share:7152344212745699328/) goes into more detail.

The project is running on Azure; contact me via LinkedIn for more info.
